Managing multiple versions of programming languages on your local machine can be a challenging task, especially with the frequent releases of new versions. Different projects often require specific versions of a programming language to build and run correctly. Therefore, efficient version management is crucial for any developer working on diverse projects. This blog post will guide you through the best practices for managing various programming language versions, allowing you to focus more on development and less on configuration.

In this blog post, we will explore various `version management tools` that can help us efficiently manage versions of programming languages and essential tools. Below is the list of programming languages and the corresponding version management tools which can be used to manage versions of those programming languages and tools on your local machine.

| Programming Language or Tool | Version Management Tools   |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Java, Groovy, Scala, Sbt     | [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) |
| Python                       | [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) |
| Golang                       | [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) |
| NodeJs                       | [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) |

# Version Managers

A version manager is a tool that helps you manage different versions of software installed on your local machine. Some version managers are specific to certain software, while others support multiple tools. Below, we will discuss various version managers that can help you efficiently manage programming language versions.

## Java, Groovy, Scala, Sbt Version Management

For Java, Groovy, Scala, and Sbt, you can use [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/) to manage multiple versions. SDKMAN! allows you to install, switch, and manage different versions of these languages with ease.

To install SDKMAN!, run:

```bash
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
```

To list the versions of Java installed via SDKMAN!, run:
```bash
sdk list java
```

To install a specific version of Java, run:
```bash
sdk install java <java_version>
```

To make a version of Java the default, run:
```bash
sdk default java <java_version>
```

Similarly, you can manage Groovy, Scala, and Sbt versions using SDKMAN!:

To install a specific version of Groovy, run:
```bash
sdk install groovy <groovy_version>
```

To install a specific version of Scala, run:
```bash
sdk install scala <scala_version>
```

To install a specific version of Sbt, run:
```bash
sdk install sbt <sbt_version>
```

## Python Version Management
For Python, `pyenv` is a popular choice. It simplifies the process of installing and switching between multiple Python versions.

To install pyenv, run:
```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

To list the versions of Python installed via pyenv, run:
```bash
pyenv versions
```

To install a specific version of Python, run:
```bash
pyenv install <python_version>
```

To set a global version of Python, run:
```bash
pyenv global <python_version>
```

## Go Version Management

The `gvm` (Go Version Manager) tool is useful for managing different versions of Go.

To install `gvm`, run:
```bash
brew update
brew install goenv
```

To list the versions of Go installed via gvm, run:
```bash
gvm list
```

To install a specific version of Go, run:
```bash
gvm install go<go_version>
```

To set a default version of Go, run:
```bash
gvm use go<go_version> --default
```

## Node.js / JavaScript Version Management
For Node.js, `nvm` (Node Version Manager) is widely used. It allows you to install and switch between different versions of Node.js effortlessly.

To install `nvm`, run:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash
```

To list the versions of Node.js installed via nvm, run:
```bash
nvm ls
```

To install a specific version of Node.js, run:
```bash
nvm install <node_version>
```

To set a default version of Node.js, run:
```bash
nvm alias default <node_version>
```

# Conclusion
Efficient version management is a critical skill for developers working on multiple projects with varying requirements. By using the right version managers, you can streamline your workflow and focus more on coding rather than configuration. Stay tuned for detailed guides on setting up and using these version managers for each programming language.

By following these best practices, you can ensure that your development environment is always ready for any project, regardless of the programming language version it requires.
